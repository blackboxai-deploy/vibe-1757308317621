## Phase 3: Authentication & User Management (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Firebase Phone Authentication implementation
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Admin dashboard for user management
- [ ] Security rules implementation and testing

## Phase 4: Course & Content Management (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Course creation and management system
